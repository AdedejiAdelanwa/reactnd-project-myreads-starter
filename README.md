It also allows you search for books by the title or author and add them to your shelves

## Resources Used

I learnt how to use debounce in my search page from this wonderful article [ How to Use Debounce and Throttle in React and Abstract them into Hooks](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/debounce-and-throttle-in-react-with-hooks/) by [Divyanshu Maithani](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/divyanshu/)

I also benefitted from the guidance of a friend [Qasim-Yusuf](https://github.com/Qausim) who tried as much as possible to make sure I read up on some concepts and also explained some to me. Plus also making fun of me.
